# Skinkr

Team ID : C22-PS300

This program uses machine learning to predict the type of acne.
The user will take a picture of their own face, the program will then send the image data to the server where the model is stored. The model will then try to predict the image, and return the prediction result to the user, along with the appropriate skincare recommendations.

The main target of this project are people with acne problems in their life. Based on the data we have stated earlier, that would be men or women around the age of 18-25 years old. We are hoping that this program will help people of Indonesia to acquire better skin health, without having the need to consult a doctor.
